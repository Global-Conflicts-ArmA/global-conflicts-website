                However that does not mean there are no baseline expectations. 
                If a role is volunteered for, it is expected a best effort is given, and if a role is no longer desired, it is expected the member steps down from that role. 
                This is true for both in and out of the game.</p>

              <p>The chain of command is set by the current mission that is being played, and is to be respected for the duration of the mission.  Any player is free to, and encouraged to take leadership, and anyone under their command is expected to follow orders no matter who they are out of game. Example: An Admin that is slotted as a rifleman is expected to follow orders of their squad leader even if the squad leader is a new player.
