# Basic radio and communication guide

The following <b>guide</b> will cover the basics of the ACRE radio mod and how also to communication using these tools.

## Radios
The interface in ACRE 2 can be reached via three different ways:

 - Press the “Open Radio” key as it is defined in the ACRE 2 keyboard controls (Default : <kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>ALT</kbd>+<kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>CAPSLOCK</kbd>)
 - Self interact via the ACE menu
 - Double click on the radio in your inventory.

You can cycle to  the \"active\" radio by pressing <kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>ALT</kbd>+<kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>CAPSLOCK</kbd>.
With the cycled to radio, you can then press <kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>LEFT</kbd> or <kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>RIGHT</kbd> ARROW key, this will put the selected radio in one ear. You can also press <kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>UP</kbd> ARROW to set the selected radio back to both ears.
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+SHIFT+DOWN ARROW will lower the overall volume of all radios. This is helpful if you need to talk with someone while the radio net is busy.


**Types of radios:**

 - The AN/PRC-343 PRR is short range lightweight intra-squad personal role radio. It is the most common \"short range\" radio people carry and features 16 channel in 16 blocks (256 channels in total) with a range up to 500 meters.

 - The AN/PRC-148 multiband Inter/Intra team radio (MBITR) is the most common \"long range\" radio players will carry.

 - The AN/PRC-152 multiband handheld radio (Harris Falcon III) does the same job as the AN/PRC-148, but is typically used less than the 148.

 - The AN/PRC-117F multiband portable manpack radio is the most powerful, heaviest, and complex radio. While the 148, 152, and 117F all do the same job, the 117F provides much greater range and thus is usually reserved for RTO/Signallers, FAC/JTAC.

 - The AN/PRC-77 is another multiband portable manpack radio. The PRC-77 is much older and can only communicate with other PRC-77's compared to the AN/PRC-148, 152, 117F, which can all talk to each other.

 - And finally, the SEM 70 (Sender/Empfänger, mobil SEM 70). A multiband portable manpack radio.

## Communications 

When communicating on the radio, you must be clear, precises, and quick with the transmission of information. Always remember, **THINK**, **PUSH**, **SPEAK**.

**THINK**
Before pushing the button, take a moment to formulate and compose the information you need into an understandable message, that all can understand.

**PUSH**
Once confident in your message, begin to transmit. 
Hold the key briefly before you start talking.

**SPEAK**
Begin to speak your message. Always start with callsign of the person you wish to speak to, followed by your own callsign, and then either send the information if it's short or give a warning order and wait for them to respond to the you/information when ready.

Speak calm, collected, and clearly, with a neutral tone.
We have players from all nations at Global Conflicts; there are many accents and types of voices, not all will be as understable over the radio, especially if the signal is poor.

#### What is a callsign?
A callsign is basically a nickname of a unit/element which quickly allows said unit to ID themselves on the net.
Typically a message on the radio net between two callsigns would start like so...
\"Hello 1'6, this is 1'3\"...
Here we can see the 1'3 callsign is trying to contact callsign 1'6, but what for?

Well, if the message is a question or a long message, typically you'd \"hail\" the other callsign first and wait for a response before sending anything, as that callsign may be busy and won't be able to listen.
But sometimes you can follow on the above message with something such as...
\"Hello 1'6, this is 1'3, contact report\"...

Here we see 1'3 is trying to send 1'6 a contact report.
This is a called a \"Warning order\". A quick snippet of information that X callsign is contacting X callsign about X subject.
This is helpful for commanders as there may be two reports at once, one a sighting report, another a contact report -  which is more of a priority.

To end 1'3's hail on the radio net to 1'6, callsign 1'3 will use \"Over\" at the end of their message like so... 
\"Hello 1'6, this is 1'3, contact report, over\"....

The word \"over\" allows the receiving callsign to know that sending callsign is done with this message and is awaiting a response.
If the sending callsign happened to send some information, but didn't necessarily need a reply, they'd use \"Out\" instead, to indicate they are done on the net completely and do not require a reply.

### Key \"Prowords\"

 - Roger/Wilco - Ok/Will comply
 - Say again - Repeat what you said.
 - Over - I'm finished with my message on the radio net and need a reply.
 - Out - I'm finish with my message on the radio net and don't need a reply.
 - Wait over/Wait one - I need a few seconds to pause and think.
 - Wait out - I'm busy, I'll get back to you shortly.
 - Correction - I made a mistake, here is the correction.
 - Disregard/Wrong - Ignore what I just said.
 - Radio check - I'm checking my signal strength with X callsign.
 - How copy/Acknowledge - Please reply to me that you understand/Acknowledge specifically what I told you.
 - Break/Roger so far - I'm taking a brief pause for you to absorb the information and continuing.
 - GRID - The location of a map grid.

### \"Bable\" and direct speech.  
ACRE2’s direct speech simulates speech coming from a player’s mouth and be heard by players around them. If you broadcast on the radio you will also be heard by other players within range of you

ACRE2 has a built in direct speech slider allowing you to determine how far your voice in direct speech should travel. The system has five states and by default starts in the middle state. The below table contains an approximated table with empirical testing.

**Changing volume state**  
Simply hold your volume modifier key (default: <kbd className='kbd kbd-xs'>TAB</kbd>) and use your scroll wheel to move the slider. The bigger the slider gets (scroll up) the further your voice will go. The smaller the slider gets (scroll down) the shorter your voice will travel.

**\"Bable\"**  
ACRE2 allows you to simulate different languages, meaning you can have BLUFOR set to speak english and OPFOR set to speak Russian.
If a player speaks a language that another player doesn’t understand the voice of that speaker will be transformed into an unintelligible sound, but one that still retains the elements of language, such as inflection, tone of voice, and cadence of speech. If you speak multiple languages you are able to switch between which language you are speaking in, and will hear people speaking any of the languages you understand unaffected by the Babel System.
