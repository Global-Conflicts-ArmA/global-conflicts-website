You can download Teamspeak from [here](https://globalconflicts.net/downloads)
 1. Open Teamspeak and click on the bookmark tab at the top and add our Teamspeak server.  
Make sure your Discord, Teamspeak, and in-game name all match.

3. You'll also want to most likely disable some Teamspeak voice notifications.  
With a lot of people leaving and joining, you'll be spammed by voice notifications often.
