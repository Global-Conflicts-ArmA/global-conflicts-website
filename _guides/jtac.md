#### What is a JTAC/FAC?
Joint Terminal Attack Controller(JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC) is a role who directs the action of combat aircraft engaged in close air support and other offensive air operations from a forward position, as well as transport operations.
Typically a JTAC/FAC is part of the Headquarters element of a unit, but not always.


#### Close air attack/Close air support (CCA/CAS)
CCA/CAS is defined as air action such as air strikes by fixed(FW) or rotary-winged(RW) aircraft against hostile targets by indirect fires, near soldiers that require detailed coordination to prevent fratricide or civilian casualties. The person calling for fire is responsible for the fireâ€™s effects.

#### How to call for CCA/CAS
Below is a \"SLATE Card\" for calling in air support.
You can find this located in-game, Open your map, on the left hand side click the following tabs, Global Conflicts>SLATE cards.

Let's break the above picture down.

**Message**

Warning order: 
The warning order is the initial start of the call for support, it allows the receiving callsign to know they are about to receive a message. The responder will reply with \"Ready to copy\" or to that effect when ready.

A - Observer's Position: 
 The observer will give their location, typically by a grid coordinate.
 If further clarification of the observers position is needed, he/she will give a location description and mark with signals if need be.

B - Target Location:
The target location will always be given by means of a grid coordinate, followed by it's elevation.

C - Target Description: 
A description of the target will be given.
Follow by if it's marked by some form of signals.

D - Further Instructions:
\t- A: The type of weapon(s) to start.
\t- B: The attack heading (Degrees)
\t- C: Clearance for danger close - Is the aircraft cleared for danger close?
\t- D: Any restrictions.
\t- E: Any threats.

E - Positions of nearest friendly force or non-combatants:
Give the location of nearest friendly callsign or non-combatants.
Or if you are the nearest friendly callsign, just say \"I am nearest friendly callsign\"

F - When to engage:
This is where you give timings to the pilot.
Do you want him/her to engage at your command, at a certain time, or our they free to fire when they please?.

**Finishing up**

You'll then end your request by saying \"READ BACK\". 
This makes the pilot who just received the request, read it all back to you so that you are sure they are hitting the correct target.
If there is an error, you let the pilot finish and then correct him using the prowords\"Wrong, I say again\" followed by your corrections, and once followed again by another \"Read back\".
This would continue until the pilot reads back the correct information.
 
Once the pilot has successfully read back the correct information, the observer will reply \"Correct, Ready for talk/walk-on\"

Once the pilot has been talked on to the target and the target has been positively identified, the observer will say \"That is your target, (effect required), you are clear to engage, over\".

At the point, the aircraft should be completely aware of it's target, friendly forces, and it's surroundings, and will most likely be  on final approach to engage. 

If at anytime you need to stop the attack, you must say \"Stop, Stop, Stop\" urgently.

**Example of a CCA/CAS mission**
  
*JTAC*: \"Hello Starlight-1, this is Hammer, CCA/CAS mission, over\"  
*PILOT*: \"Ready to copy\"  
*JTAC*: \"My location is GRID 47891303, single story stone building with a red roof, marked by green smoke, target location is GRID 47501371, elevation 183m, target description is 3x T-72s static on a crossroads, marked by red flare, Break/roger so far....\"  
*PILOT*: \"Send/go ahead/roger\"  
*JTAC*: Engage with 2x 500lb GBU, on attack heading degrees 175, cleared for danger close, no other threats, nearest friendly forces are 600m west of *my* location in the town of dagon, attack in figures 1,5 (15mins), Read back, over\"  
*PILOT*: *Reads back wrong message*  
*JTAC*: Wrong, I say again, target GRID 47891303, over.  
*PILOT*: *Reads back correctly this time*  
*JTAC*: \"Correct, call ready for talk on\".  
*JTAC*: *Will proceed to walk/talk the pilot onto the target directly*  
*PILOT*: *Positively IDs the target*  
*Sender*: \"This is your target, (Effect required), you are clear to engage, over (or out)\"  

**Tools of the trade**

Below is a list of some items you might find and use as a JTAC/FAC:

 - Typically most JTAC/FACs will have multiple radios, the AN/PRC-117F for air comms, a AN/PRC-148 for ground comms, and a AN/PRC-343 for comms to HQ.
 - Vector 21 rangefinders  - Used to get a range and degree of the target.
 - Laser designator - Used for marking targets by laser for friendly air strikes. 
 - Map, Compass, and Map tools.
 - Colour smokes and flares.
 - MICRO dagr - GPS with lots of built in features to massively help JTAC/FACs.
 - Ctab - Commanders tablet, an Ipad/Android phone that allows you to track other callsigns with a Ctab in real time, watch real time helmet cams, and also message other callsigns via text.
 - Spotting scope - Very powerful viewing optics.
