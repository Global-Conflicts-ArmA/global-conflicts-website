# Infantry Core Handbook
The intent of the handbook is to establish helpful Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures that not only improve the effectiveness of in-game actions, but also to uphold teamwork.

This handbook is therefore held as a basis of expected in-game performance and behavior for all players of our community.



<h2 id="the-squad-fireteam-buddy-team">The Squad, Fireteam and the Buddy Team</h2>

**Squad:**
 * Mission tasks are assigned to squads (or sections). 
 * A squad should work with the other squads and friendly elements in a fluid manner for the completion of the task.

**The Squad Leader (SL):**
 * Is responsible for everything the squad does or fails to do.
 * Receives the mission plan and explains how he intends on
   accomplishing it to his squad members.
 * Breaks down the task into smaller ones and delegates them to his
   fireteam leaders (TLs).
 * Is attent to the status of his squad members and keeps a “mental map”
   for his squad position in the battlefield.
 * Is always present to his squad members and has a good disposition against unplanned events. 
 * Focuses on leading, letting his squad members do the fighting.
 * Has a good amount of initiative and is communicative.

**Fireteam:**
* It’s the smallest element which goes out to complete the tasks   
   delegated by the SL.
* Each fireteam should have dedicated tasks
   and work together to boost the squad effectiveness.

**Fireteam Leader (TL):**
 * Personally controls each member of his team, including where to watch and where to shoot.
 * Must have a good understanding of the mission plan including the location of other friendly elements. 
 * Is ready to take control of the squad if the SL is put out of action.
 * Is very vocal so that every member of his team can hear and execute his instructions.
 * Assign buddy teams at the start of the mission.
 * Is in the fight, but from a more safe position.

**Buddy Team:**
  * A two-man team that will try to stay together through the mission.
  * Helps each other with covering different areas, digging trenches, clearing buildings and buddy aid.


<h2 id="the-start-of-the-mission">The start of the mission</h2>

The start of the mission is crucial. Before stepping out, everybody should know what they will be doing. As such, SLs should take a moment to sit down with his squad and **explain the plan and how he plans to execute it.**
Radio checks and equipment checks should be made.
Some missions won’t give this time to the players after the briefing. If this is the case, extra time during the briefing should be allowed so that the SLs can explain to their squads what to do.

## Spacing
The default spacing is **10m**. You can use the DUI radar to estimate your distance:
![alt_text](http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/dui-spacing.png "image_tooltip")
The spacing should be adjusted depending on the situation. Decreased in dense areas, increased in dangerous environments. 


## Formations

### Ordering Formations: 

As a SL or TL, you should **think before you speak**, and you must be as **clear as possible**.
As anything else, you should always give some sort of feedback to your leader, signaling that you received the command and understood it.
For example, the SL may say:  
  
_Squad, form line, facing west, walking pace, weapons up, stop at the treeline._  
  
And then you can simply say:  
  
_Line west, walking, weapons up._  
  
This also ensures that the guy next to you also got the order. This is called “**Echoing orders**”. Always echo orders, it reasures your leader that you are listening.


### The File
Used when moving in non contested areas and contact is not expected.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/file-theory.png" alt="The file" style="width:300px;"/>


### The Line

Used when there is a need to maximize frontal firepower.
In an idealistic scenario the squad members should not be in a perfect line, but instead be staggered to avoid enfilade fire from the flanks.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/line-theory.png" alt="The line" style="width:100%;"/>




### The Wedge

This is the default fireteam formation, but it can be used as a squad. 
Each wing of the formation should be covering their respective sides.
The wedge, when applied to a fireteam, can be HEAVY LEFT, meaning that the Automatic Rifleman/Machinegunner will be on the left. HEAVY RIGHT for the inverse.  
If the TL has not called HEAVY LEFT or HEAVY RIGHT, the AR/MG should position himself in the opposite flank where the majority of his fireteam mates are.

|--|--|
|A squad wedge.|A fireteam wedge. | 


### The Column

The column is a squad formation where the fireteams are arranged in a wedge one behind another. This is the default squad formation when traveling in contested areas.
If the squad has two TLs, then the SL should ideally be positioned in the middle between the fireteams.
This formation provides good dispersion laterally and in-depth without sacrificing control. It facilitates maneuver while maintaining a fighting posture. Note that this formation only makes sense in a squad context.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/squad-column-theory.png" alt="The column" style="width:300px;"/>





### The Staggered Column

The staggered Column is primarily used when traveling down roads, specifically in urban areas. It separates the squad onto either side of the road to decrease the vulnerability to machine gun fire. Allows easy response to enemy ambushes
If able, the fireteams should each take one side of this formation. Each member should position himself behind his squadmate that is on the opposite side. Note this formation is not a substitute for proper urban operations techniques.

|--|--|

### Default formation
When no formation has been ordered, the members of the squad should assume a loose wedg facing the perceived direction of danger. 

## Movement Techniques
These are the ways to move as a platoon or squad.

### Traveling
This is simply moving to a position without any tactical consideration. This should be avoided in contested areas.

### Traveling overwatch
A considerable distance between elements when moving. This is intended to allow for more tactical decisions and mutual support.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/traveling-overwatch.png" alt="Traveling overwatch" style="width:100%;"/>

##### An example of traveling overwatch, where the trailing element can fire over and support the lead element.


### Bounding overwatch

One team covers and/or shoots, and the other moves. This is the essence of bounding overwatch. There are two types of bounding overwatch:

* **Successive Bounds:**  
One element starts the bound, and upon reaching the desired position, they will signal and the other element will move up to the first element in a rough line.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/sucessive-boundings.gif" alt="Sucessive boundings" style="width:100%;"/>



     **This is how a SL can call this movement technique:**
        
    *SL*: Alright! We will bound forward here. Blue team will advance 50m first, Red team, you are covering. Call when ready!    
    *Blue TL*: Blue Ready.  
    *Red TL*: Red Ready.  
    *SL*: Blue, go!  
    *Blue TL*: Blue team moving, on me!  
    **Blue team makes their move, assumes an overwatch position and signals that they are set.**  
    *Blue TL*: Blue Set!  
    *Red TL*: Red team moving, on me!  
    **Red team moves up to Blue Team, forming a rough squad line and signals that they are set.**  
    *Red TL*: Red Set!  



* **Alternating Bounds:**  
Same thing as the previous, but the other element will move past the first, aiming for useful areas to hold.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/alternating-boundings.gif" alt="Alternate boundings" style="width:100%;"/>

    **This is how a SL can call this movement technique:**
    
    *SL*: Listen up! We will do alternate boundings up to that compound. We will have to move in the open, so go prone once you are set. We will move in 75m steps. Blue team will go first, Red will cover. Call when ready!  
    *Blue TL*: Blue Ready.  
    *Red TL*: Red Ready.  
    *SL*: Blue, go!  
    *Blue TL*: Blue team moving, on me!  
    **Blue team makes their move, assumes an overwatch position and signals that they are set.**  
    *Blue TL*: Blue Set!  
    *Red TL*: Red team moving, on me!  
    **Red team moves up and goes past where the blue team is another 75 meters. Then they stop and assume overwatch positions.**  
    *Red TL*: Red Set!  



## Security 

During movement there will be periods when the squad has to halt, depending on the reason the squad will either take a short or long halt.

### Short Halt
Upon hearing this command, everyone should cover different directions while remaining in formation.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/short-halt.gif" alt="Short halt" style="width:100%;"/>


### Long Halt
This is not a specific command that will be issued, but the idea is to take better defensible positions at the expense of the formation. The SL will simply tell the squad to hold and take cover.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/long-halt.gif" alt="Long halt" style="width:100%;"/>


## Vehicle Movement Techniques

The same techniques mentioned above also apply to transport vehicles that infantry can utilize in missions, like HMMWV, MRAPs, trucks and technicals. However there are a few extra factors that should be understood and mastered.

### The Dangers of Arma Physics
In multiplayer games the physics simulation of objects can get a bit “erratic”. For this reason, players should be extra careful with vehicles and everything that has simulated physics.
With that in mind, at Global Conflicts, we will always use the staggered column formation when traveling with vehicles on roads. This maximizes the amount of spacing directly in front of each vehicle, giving more time for a vehicle to react to sudden stops.

 
- [Never try to overtake someone.](https://youtu.be/NJyBt5D40B4?t=10)
- Never tailgate.
- Never break check.
- Always keep a minimum distance of 50m between vehicles when moving at high speeds (40 km/h+).  

This is how a staggered vehicle column looks like:
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/vehicle-staggered-column.png" alt="Vehicle staggered column" style="width:100%;"/>
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/vehicle-staggered-column-topview.png" alt="Vehicle staggered column top view" style="width:100%;"/>


### Choosing a Driver
Ideally leaders should never drive vehicles. They should sit next to the driver and help with navigation and pay attention to the surroundings.
The driver role should be delegated to players with non-critical weapon systems. However, there are factors that can change this. These are: Bad internet, if the player knows that he will have to be AFK, or if the player is a known bad driver.

### Choosing a Gunner
 The TL or SL should designate someone with a non-critical weapon system to hop on the gun. The gunner should always be communicating what he sees to the people inside the vehicle. The gunner should note where the other vehicles gunners in the column are watching and cover different directions. In case the convoy/vehicle gets ambushed, gunners should immediately return at least suppressive fire.

### Security Halts
There are two main formations to be executed when performing halts: Herringbone and Triangle “Y”.  
Use the **Herringbone** when the halt is shorter or temporary. Unless told otherwise by leadership, the gunners stay mounted and everybody else dismounts and provides security nearby.  
The **Triangle Y** is used when there is a need to block the road or provide fire capabilities down the axis of the road.

## Contact and Sighting Reports

A contact happens when you are engaging with an enemy element.

A sighting happens when you simply see another element is either enemy or unknown. Note that hearing falls into this type of report as well.

When reporting, either a contact or sighting report locally, that is, to people around you via voice or squad radio, focus on just passing down as much information as needed so that the people around you can understand it - Don’t make it more complicated than it needs to be. 

There are no hard rules or SOPs when reporting, however, there are a few important key concepts that everyone should be aware of. These are: 


* Be brief and methodical. Don’t add unnecessary adjectives or verbiage to what you need to say.
    * **DO**: _Enemy sniper in the church tower!_
    * **DON’T**: _There is a damn sneaky sniper camping in that church tower over there._
* Be precise and if necessary use distinguishable references.
    * **DO**: _Enemy RPG inside the 2-story white building with blue trimmings!_
    * **DON’T**: _There is a dude inside that building!_
* Look out for details. A BTR-80A is much more of a threat than a BTR-80.
    * **DO**: _Enemy BMP-2 coming down the road!_
    * **DON’T**: _Enemy APC on the road!_
* Where are they going? If your contact is moving, remember to say their direction of travel.
    * **DO**: _Enemy patrol, north east, 500m, 5 men strong, moving west to east!_
    * **DON’T**: _Enemy infantry, north east, about 5 men strong._
* Are you in an ambush? Don’t worry too much, simply yell contact and the direction the shots as fast you can. Elaborate later.
    * **DO**: _CONTACT LEFT!_
    * **DON’T**: _UUHHH, Enemy squad size element bearing 2-7-0, 40 meters._

Remember the “3Ds” to report a contact: _Description, direction and distance._ 

When reporting contacts or sightings via platoon radios, you should first try to formulate what you need to say before transmitting. Don’t worry too much about formalities here, but you should remember that only one person can speak on the radio net at a time, so communicate as effectively as the situation permits.

If you just see an enemy or unknown element, use terms like “**VISUAL ON**” or “**EYES ON**”.  
If you just hear an enemy or unknown element, use terms like “**HEARING**” or “**AUDIO CONTACT**”  
If you are being engaged or are engaging an enemy or unknown element, use “**CONTACT**”  

Here are some examples of contact reports via platoon radios:

 * *6 THIS 1, VISUAL ON ENEMY ENEMY SQUAD, MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST, NOT ACTIVE. GRID: 324 556. OVER.*
 *  *2 THIS 1, HEY WATCH OUT, THERE IS AN ENEMY RPG TEAM ON BUILDING RED 5.*
    * Note: Here you are saying “Hey watch out” as a means to grab the other’s squad attention and to tell them to be careful. Building “Red 5” was previously marked on the map and it’s easily referenceable.
* *BREAK, 1 SQUAD HAS CONTACT CLOSE TO OUR EAST!*
    * Note: Here you immediately use BREAK because it’s an important message(This is used in emergencies and any other traffic on the radio net should be stopped so that you can transmit and be heard), you are being ambushed and you need to let everyone know ASAP. Develop the situation, win the immediate fight and elaborate the contact report when able.
* _6 THIS IS 1, EYES ON ENEMY ZU-32 MTLB, NOT ACTIVE BUT OVERWATCHING OUR ATACK AXIS. GRID: 275 182 - IT’S ON THE TREELINE. OVER._

* _6 THIS IS 1, BE ADVISED: ONE OF MY GUYS SAW 2 ENEMY SQUADS PATROLLING THE ROADS IN AND AROUND CHERNO, THEY HAVE A TOW LAUNCHER OVERWATCHING THE ROAD. THIS WAS ABOUT 2 MINUTES AGO. BREAK. THEY WERE TALKING WITH A CIVILIAN. I BELIEVE THEY ARE SETTING UP AN AMBUSH ON OUR RETREAT ROUTE. OVER._
    * Note: Here you are using BREAK as a pause between your sentences, to take a breather and let your listeners process the information. You concluded the report with your assessment of the situation. When using the BREAK to pause your sentence, you must let go of the PTT.


## Common Battle Drills
Battle drills are initiated on a cue, such as an enemy action or the leader’s order, and are a trained response to the situation.


### React to Direct Fire  
**Conditions:** The enemy initiates direct fire contact on the unit.   
**Cue:** This drill begins when the enemy initiates direct fire contact.    
**Standards**: The element in contact returns fire immediately and seeks cover. Elements in contact locate the enemy and initiate suppressive fire on suspected enemy positions. The leader of the unit in contact gathers information and formulate a quick reaction, which can be to break contact or to press on towards the enemy, he reports the contact up the chain of command and what he will be doing about it.

### React to Indirect Fire  
**Conditions**: The element is receiving indirect fire.   
**Cue**: This drill begins when any member alerts, “INCOMING,” or a round impacts.   
**Standards**: Squad members immediately seek the best available cover and spread out. The SL rallies his troops via radio or via voice and orders them to move to a designated position away from the targeted area. SL reports the contact up the chain of command.

### React to Ambush  
**Conditions**: The unit is moving and surprised by unexpected contact.  
**Cue**: This drill begins when the enemy initiates an ambush.  
**Standards**: Individuals in the kill zone immediately return fire on known or suspected enemy positions and push out of the kill zone. Individuals not in the kill zone locate and place suppressive fire on the enemy. If possible throw smokes at the suspected enemy position.

### Break Contact  
**Conditions**: The unit is in an active exchange of fire.  
**Cue**: This drill begins when the unit leader gives the command to break contact.   
**Standards**: The unit breaks contact using bounding movements, and continues to move until the enemy cannot observe or place fire on them.

### Dismounting   
**Conditions**:  The squad is mounted in a vehicle.  
**Cue**: This drill begins when the order is given to prepare to dismount.   
**Standards**: The vehicle commander announces that they are nearing the dismount area. The Squad Leader reminds each fireteam where they should assemble after dismounting. On dismount, the fireteams move to their predesignated positions and establish security. Extra attention to not linger behind the vehicle, as it might need to reverse suddenly.



#### Note: The Difference Between Direct Contact and Ambush
These are the characteristics of an ambush: High volumes of initial fire, fire will come from your flanks and the enemy might make use of explosives. In general, it will feel like you are in a zone designed to kill you as fast as possible, while in a simple direct fire contact you will feel like the enemy is just as confused as you are.
  
It falls upon the SL to decide what to do and the squad members should follow it without questioning. There is no time for arguing during a gunfight. It’s better to maintain cohesion and discuss what happened after the mission. It will make for a more enjoyable experience and remember that this is a game.


## Other Concepts:

### Usage of smoke grenades
Smokes greatly impact the battlefield and can cause more harm than good for you and your team.
Smokes should not be used as a first reaction to contact. Ideally, smoke grenades should only be used when asked by a TL or SL.
In any situation, always first check the direction of the wind and think where you would need to throw the smoke so that it billows out in the direction you want to obscure. Below are some examples of how to best use smoke grenades.

### Assaulting a fortified position

 - **Situation: You have a supporting element**  
    If you have a supporting friendly element that can provide covering/suppressive fire onto the enemy position, do not throw smokes that would obscure their vision. It’s better to throw smokes to isolate the objective area from enemy flanking fire and in-depth positions.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/smoke-with-support-element.jpg" alt="Smoke with supporting element" style="width:100%;"/>

- **Situation: You DON’T have a supporting element**  
    If your unit is alone and must assault, focus on blinding the enemy with smokes first. This will is a palliative measure in place of suppressive fire from your friendly supporting element.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/smoke-without-support-element.jpg" alt="Smoke without supporting element" style="width:100%;"/>

###  Running across an open field under fire
Throw smokes towards the direction of fire, away from friendlies. See where other smokes have landed and try to create a smoke screen to obscure the path your team must take as much as possible.
Don’t run with a primed smoke grenade. You will not be obscured and you will create chaos for the people behind you.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/smoke-running-across-open.jpg" alt="Running across the open smoke" style="width:100%;"/>



###  Retreating
Throw smoke towards the enemy position to put a wall between you and the enemy. If possible also throw a decoy smoke in a direction in which you will not be moving to.
Don’t throw smoke at your own position.
<img src="http://content.globalconflicts.net/guides/infantry-core/smoke-retreating.jpg" alt="Reatreating smoke" style="width:100%;"/>

### In Arma, the AI vision IS blocked by smoke. [Here is an example of AI being affected by smoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn-sfGTMrmg).

### Enfilade fire 
Enfilade fire occurs when the target presents itself in a concentrated arc for the shooter. It can be frontal fire on an enemy column formation or flanking fire on an enemy line formation. This is the most desirable class of fire with respect to the target because it makes maximum use of the beaten zone. MGs/ARs should always strive to position themselves in places where this type of fire onto the enemy is likely. The more the firing position approaches this, the better.

### Target Precedence / Priority:
Understanding your role in your team is paramount for a well rounded and effective fighting force.

For example:

Your team comes into contact with the following enemy composition: _Massed troops walking down a road, their SL is easily visible, a technical truck is following the formation_.

As a machine gunner, you should begin by engaging the massed troops before they can disperse. After they are neutralized or dispersed, switch focus towards the enemy technical. Once that’s done, start engaging targets of opportunity.

As a marksman/sniper(or if you have an optic on your rifle), you should begin by killing their SL. Then focus on killing the gunner of the technical. After all, it is still a crew served weapon. Once that’s done, start engaging targets of opportunity.

Remember that this is very dependent on the situation. It’s important that you know how to adapt to the situation at hand.
