## The basics
**Joining/Leaving and attendance commitments**
We **don't** have any mandatory attendance for our sessions/operations/missions or for trainings.
Play as often or as little as you like!
We cater for busy people with busy lives.

Our sessions run every weekend, SAT+SUN 1900UTC.
Missions will begin at this time, but you can join or leave anytime during the session you please, with most missions supporting join in progress (JIP)

**Roles and ranks**
Many other units have set roles for each person and a rigid rank structure.
At Global Conflicts, you are free to take whatever you want, from being the company commander one mission, to a rifleman the next, the choice is yours!
Your rank/level of power will be determined by the role you take in the mission and will not carry over into the next or out of game.

We recommend taking an entry role or a basic command role like Team leader/2IC for your first few missions.

**DLCs**
Currently we support - but not required: [Apex](https://store.steampowered.com/app/395180/Arma_3_Apex/) and   [S.O.G. Prairie Fire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227700/Arma_3_Creator_DLC_SOG_Prairie_Fire/)
If you have the DLCs downloaded, our launcher will automatically pick them up.
If you don't have the DLCs, you will still be able to play with the assests such a vehicles, weapons, and equipment, but you won't be able to play on the maps that come with the DLC.

### Your first time playing

So you've set up the Swifty and Teamspeak, it's the weekend, meaning it's Arma time! 
But how? Where do I go? What role do I take? Who do I talk to?  
Well... Let's explain.

1. Ideally join our Teamspeak server around 15mins prior to 1900UTC.
2. In Teamspeak you'll see a collection of channels.  
Proceed to the "Waiting room" where users join and wait for a mission.

3. At this time while joining Teamspeak, you can also join the main game server and wait for the session to start.
4.  At 1900UTC, a Game Moderator will put up a mission based on the current player count and also based off of the [](http://www.globalconflicts.net/missions/top-voted)[top voted missions this week](http://www.globalconflicts.net/missions/top-voted).
5. If you are in the game server, at this time you'll see a handful of roles.  
The Game Moderator will "call" for a commanding officer (CO) for the mission.  
Once this role is filled, the commander will once again call for what roles he/she wants.  
If the commander is happy with the filled roles, he/she will ask to proceed to the brief.
You are free to take any role from the Commanding officers, down to a rifleman, the choice is yours.
 6.	At this time the mission will load into the map screen where the CO has a maximum time limit of 15 minutes to form a plan for the mission.  
During this time, it is best to reference the "Briefing" tab on the left hand side, which every mission will have.  
After some time, the commander will brief his team. Once complete, the Game Moderator will push the mission in-game or otherwise known as "live".  
Teamspeak will move all clients into one large in-game channel.

	Some mission are TVT/PVP.  
If this is the case, during the brief, each team will split Teamspeak channels.

7.	Done!  
    Now you should be in-game.  
    Listen to your chain of command, don't be afraid to ask anybody a question, and don't forget to have fun!
