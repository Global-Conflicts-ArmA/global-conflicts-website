# Welcome to Global Conflicts  
This guide is intended for new players to our community and will cover everything needed to know about joining, getting set-up, and playing with us. 

## The basics

**Roles and ranks**  
Many other units have set roles for each person and a rigid rank structure.
At Global Conflicts, you are free to take whatever you want, from being the company commander one mission, to a rifleman the next, the choice is yours!
Your rank/level of power will be determined by the role you take in the mission and will not carry over into the next or out of game.

We recommend taking an entry role or a basic command role like Team leader/2IC for your first few missions.

**Joining and Leaving**
We don't have any mandatory attendance for our sessions/operations/missions or for trainings.
We cater for busy people with busy lives.

We run sessions every Saturday and Sunday at 1900UTC.
Missions will begin at this time, but you can join or leave anytime during the session you please, with most missions supporting join in progress (JIP)

**DLCs**
Currently we support - but not require: [Apex](https://store.steampowered.com/app/395180/Arma_3_Apex/) and   [S.O.G. Prairie Fire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227700/Arma_3_Creator_DLC_SOG_Prairie_Fire/)

For the Apex DLC, if you don't own it, you can still use all the content from the DLC without any restrictions. The only limitation is that you won't be able to play on the Tanoa map.

For the S.O.G Praire Fire DLC, if you don't own it, you must subscribe to the [\"Compatibility Data for Non-Owners\"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2477276806). This will allow you to use every infantry equipment and hop in as passenger on any vehicle that the DLC offers (However, you will see an ad for the DLC when using its content). You won't be able to crew (driver/gunner/commander) its vehicles and play on its maps (Cam Lao Nam, Khe Sanh and The Bra). 


## Getting started
Firstly, start by joining our  [Discord](https://discord.globalconflicts.net/) if you haven't already.

**Downloading the mods:**
Head to the [download page](https://globalconflicts.net/downloads) and download Swifty. This is a program used by many communities to synchronize modpacks in an easy way. Follow  [this guide](https://globalconflicts.net/guides/swifty) for more instructions on how to download our modpack using it.
 

**Teamspeak:**

1. Open Teamspeak and click on the bookmark tab at the top and add our Teamspeak server.  
Make sure your Discord, Teamspeak, and in-game name all match.

2. Take your time to play with your settings.

3. You'll also want to most likely disable some Teamspeak voice notifications.  
With a lot of people leaving and joining, you'll be spammed by voice notifications often.

4. Once you have bookmarked us and adjusted the settings to your liking, you are all done for the Teamspeak set-up!

**Joining your first session with us:**

So you've set up the Swfity and teamspeak, everything is working, and it's the weekend meaning it's Arma time! 
Now you want to get on and play with us, but how? Where do I go? What role do I take? Who do I talk to?  
Well... Let's explain.

Here's how you join!

1. Ideally join our Teamspeak server around 15mins prior to 1900UTC.
2. In Teamspeak you'll see a collection of channels.  
Proceed to the \"Waiting room\" where users join and wait for a mission. *This channel requires push-to-talk.*

3. At the same time, or any time for that matter, while joining Teamspeak, you should also connect to the main game server. - If you need the IP it can be located in the Teamspeak channels description.
4. At 1900UTC, a Game Moderator will put up a mission based on the current player count and also based off of the [](http://www.globalconflicts.net/missions/top-voted)[top voted missions this week](http://www.globalconflicts.net/missions/top-voted).
5. If you are in the game server at this time you'll see a handful of roles.  
The Game Moderator will \"call\" for a commanding officer (CO) for the mission.  
Once this role is filled, the commander will call for which roles he/she wants.
If the commander is happy with the filled roles, he/she will ask to proceed to the brief.
You are free to take any role from the Commanding officers, down to a rifleman, the choice is yours.
 6. At this time the mission will load into the map screen where the CO has a maximum time limit of 15 minutes to form a plan for the mission.  
During this time, it is best to reference the \"Briefing\" tab on the left hand side, which every mission will have.  
After some time, the commander will brief his team. Once complete, the Game Moderator will push the mission in-game or otherwise known as \"live\".  
Teamspeak will move all clients into one large in-game channel.

Some missions are TVT/PVP.  
If this is the case, during the brief, each team will split Teamspeak channels.

7. Done!  
    Now you should be in-game.  
    Listen to your chain of command, don't be afraid to ask anybody a question, and don't forget to have fun!
