# Welcome to Global Conflicts  
This guide is intended for new players to our community and will cover everything needed to know about joining, getting set-up, and playing with us.

*By playing with us, you acknowledge you have read and understood the [Rules and Standards](https://globalconflicts.net/guides/rules)*

## The basics

**Joining/Leaving and attendance commitments**

We **don't** have any mandatory attendance for our sessions/operations/missions or for trainings.
Play as often or as little as you like!
We cater for busy people with busy lives.

Every Saturday and Sunday we play ArmA Reforger starting at 1900 UTC. 
<br/>Missions will begin at this time, but you can join or leave anytime during the session you please, with most missions supporting join in progress (JIP)

**Roles and ranks**

Many other units have set roles for each person and a rigid rank structure.
At Global Conflicts, you are free to take whatever you want, from being the company commander one mission, to a rifleman the next, the choice is yours!
Your rank/level of power will be determined by the role you take in the mission and will not carry over into the next or out of game.

We recommend taking an entry role or a basic command role like Team leader/2IC for your first few missions.

## Your first time playing

It's the weekend, meaning it's Arma time! 
But how? Where do I go? What role do I take? Who do I talk to?  
Watch the following video for a quick run down on your first session.
