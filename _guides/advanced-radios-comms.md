# Advanced radio and communication guide

The following guide will cover the more advanced side of the ACRE radio mod and how also to communication using these tools.

## Radios
### Radio signal loss
**Terrain and object interference**
ACRE 2 realistically traces a signal path from the transmitting radio to any potential receivers. At the frequencies used on the currently available radios. The radio waves act mostly like light, in the sense that they are blocked or attenuated by objects and the ground.

Unlike light these radio waves can still penetrate things like walls to some extent, but they will lose power and the range of the radio will be reduced. This might not affect a transmitter if he/she is in a lone building, blocked by few walls, in otherwise open terrain, but it will reduce signal strength and range inside a city or built-up areas.

Terrain will outright block VHF and UHF signals. Some waves can bleed through via scattering and reflection, by bouncing radio waves off of other materialed objects ideally such as large solid flat surfaces, which can be achieved by bending antennas, but generally radios on these bands are considered to be Line of Sight (LOS) radios as far as terrain is concerned.

**Radio interference**
Multiple transmissions on the same frequency, at the same time, can be destructive for signal.
Not only will all callsigns hear several other callsigns talking at once, but while multiple people talk at the same time, it degrades the overall quality of all transmissions.

**Antennas**
The antenna direction for infantry is simulated as being relative to the direction of their back.
When transmitting or receiving communications, the information is being fed through your antenna, so it's direction is important in regards to signal strength.

You can bend your antenna via ACE self interaction>Radios.
A perfect time to bend your antenna is when prone in a ditch.

## Communications 

### Report types
- Contact Report - When a callsign wants to send information about an enemy contact they are in or recently had.
- Sighting Report - When a callsigns wants to send a detailed information about an enemy force they are observing.
- Situation Report - When a callsign wants to send information about their general status.
- ACE Report - A report that sends the status of Ammo, Casualties, and Equipment, to a callsign.

### Key \"Prowords\"

 - Nothing heard - To be used when no reply is received from a callsign.
 - Read back - Repeat this entire transmission back to me exactly as received
 - Out to you - I'm finished talking to X callsign and I'm starting a new message with X callsign without hanging up.
 - Relay to - I can't reach X callsign, can you please relay this message through you to them.
 - Through me - Relay your message through me to X callsign.
 - Priority - I have an urgent message, everyone stop talking.
 ### Relaying
If you are out of range of a callsign and need to send information to them, you can perform a relay. This is essentially where you pass information from you, to a middle man, who then passes that you the final callsign.

You can achieve this by the following \"Hello 1'1 this is 1'2, relay to 1'6,_____, over\"
You can also assist other callsigns on the net who are trying to reach someone out of range.

This can be achieved  via two methods.

 1. Offering your callsign to relay.
 2. Offering another callsign to relay.

To offer yourself to relay you would say:
\"Hello 2'4, this 2'3, relay through me to 2'6, over\"

To offer another callsign who you know is in range, you would say:
\"Hello 2'4, this 2'3, relay through 2'2 for 2'6, over.\"
