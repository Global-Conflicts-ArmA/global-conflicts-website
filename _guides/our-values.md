A straight forward community with one aim.

To give people the option to play casually with no commitment, in a semi-serious environment, yet provide high quality realistic missions that are not locked to one faction or point in time.

Fun is the ultimate goal. The point is to have fun - in our case, we strive for organized, disciplined fun.
