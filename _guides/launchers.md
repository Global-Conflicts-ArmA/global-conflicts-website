# Anti-tank/air launcher guides

This page aims to cover several types of launchers/anti-tank launched weapons.
More basics types of AT *may* not included. 

## Guided anti-tank
### Javelin (3cb)
The Javelin comes in two parts, the CLU and the missile/tube.
To fire the Javelin, these two parts must first be connected.

The Javelin is a one use item. Once fired, you can dispose of the tube, but keep the CLU as you'll need this to fire more Javelins later, and can also be used as a powerful observation tool separately.

 1. Press either CTRL+B or self interact>equipment to assemble the launcher.
 2. To switch between firing modes (Direct or top down), press CTRL+TAB. - This will be indicated be the icons on the right when aiming down sight.
 3. Press either + or - on your numpad to zoom in and out.
 4. Press N to switch between thermals or regular vision. - To obtain a lock, you **must** be in thermal mode.
 5. Hold either the TAB or T key (depending on what your ACE "Lock Target (Hold)" key is bound to"), to begin obtaining a lock.
 6. You'll hear a beeping tone while it attempts to lock, and a solid tone with white crosshairs over the target when the Javelin is locked.
 7. Once fired, press CTRL+B or self interact>equipment to dissemble the launcher.

### NLAW (3cb)
The NLAW is a one use item. Once fired, you can dispose of the tube.
NLAW uses Predicted Line Of Sight guidance. Before firing the shooter tracks the targets for several seconds. This programs the missile with the angular rotation and allows it to fly a curved path that will hit the target. It will also correct for gravity drop.

- NLAW also has a built in range finder which can be use by pressing T while aiming down sight.
- NLAW can be dumb fired without a lock.

 1. Aim down sight and select your fire mode, either direct or top down with CTRL+TAB - This will be indicated in the top right with a hint telling which mode is selected.
 2. To obtain a lock, the operator must track the target while holding the TAB key for approximately 3 seconds before firing - There is **no** tracking tone or change in the sight to indicate a lock. The operator must trust good will he's tracked the target for a few seconds.
 3. While continuing to hold TAB, once the operator is ready, fire the NLAW.
 4. At this point you can dispose of the launcher.

NLAW's Predicted Line Of Sight guidance is not perfect. Targets moving to fast can make the rocket overshoot or similar. If a target was to suddenly turn sharply or stop with the missile close to it, the missile will most likely also miss.
While the NLAW is guided, it also does require some level of knowledge from the operator to understand the probability of actually hitting the target when including factors such as vehicle speed.
Leading on the target can help NLAW to hit, but is still not guaranteed.

### Spike LR
**For the Spike LR to function correctly, PIP must be enabled in your video options**

The Spike LR is not a disposable launcher and requires new rockets to be loaded each time.
Spike LR has two guided firing modes, either manual tracking or automated tracking.
- Press N to change between thermals or regular vision.

 1. Aim down sight and find your target.
 2. Choose between manual or auto targeting - By default, manual mode is selected which is indicated by "MANAUAL" while aiming down sight. Holding T will begin to track the target in the sight for auto targeting mode, which is indicated by a small crosshair following the target.
 3. If using automated targeting, once you have a lock on the target, you can simply fire and watch your rocket travel via a camera attached to it, or if using manual targeting mode, follow your target, fire, and then guide the rocket using your mouse while watching from the rockets onboard camera.
 4. Reload.

## Guided anti-air
### Shorts Blowpipe
The shorts blowpipe is known to be a rather ineffective anti-air weapon.
It has no lock on features and solely relies on the operators ability to track the target with their mouse movement.

The blowpipe is not a single use launcher and can be reloaded.

 1. Aim down sight and find your target.
 2. Fire the blowpipe.
 3. Guide the rocket with your mouse within your line of sight.
 4. Reload.
### Stinger, Igla, Strela
Each of these anti-air launcher operate very similar to each other.
Simply hold TAB while aiming towards an air vehicle, you should begin to hear a beeping tone and a broken green box.
Once the target is locked, the tone should become solid, and the green box becomes full.

The biggest hinderance to this weapon platform is the operator and knowing when to fire.
Firing on targets to close at to steep of an arc or similar can result in the rocket over shooting the target.

## Non-guided anti-tank
Almost all Non-guided anti-tank launchers can either be zeroed using PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys or using CTRL+SCROLL WHEEL.
Although some launchers may not allow this and will instead have a built in range table in the scope which you simply align the target to.
### RPG-7V2
Below you can find an image displaying the PGO-7V3 sight and the aiming points depending on your type of round.


### AT4 (RHS)
The AT4 can be zeroed by using the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys or using CTRL+SCROLL WHEEL, and is a one use item, so dispose of the tube after use.
The AT4 has a single iron sight with the option of switching between a narrow or wide field of view by pressing / on the numpad.
Changing sights only works for the RHS AT4.


### RPG-18,26, RShG, 
All these small RPGs operate similar with regards to their sights.
Each RPG can be zeroed using PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys or using CTRL+SCROLL WHEEL, but each one can also switch between an aiming sight and a more general viewing sight by either press / on the numpad or by holding CTRL and right clicking with the mouse.
