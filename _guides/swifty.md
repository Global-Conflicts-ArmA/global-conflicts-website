4.  In the field called  **path**, direct Swifty to where you want to install your mods.  
    This can be anywhere, inside or out the Arma directory. Just make sure it's on the same HDD/SSD as your Arma 3.  
    Create a folder with a descriptive name, such as "Global Conflicts Mods" in your chosen location and select this folder.
    
5.  In the top right hand corner, click the little  ![Swifty Cog](https://i.imgur.com/CWD89aA.png)  icon.  
    Once opened, you'll see a tab called application, and in here a field called "Arma III Directory". This is the path to your Arma 3 folder. By default it's in your "steamapps" folder. You can find it by right clicking your Arma 3 on Steam > Manage > Browse Game Files.
    
    Increasing the parallel downloads can increase the download speed.  ![Global Conflicts Swifty repository Configuration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/375365768105426954/1119606490643316736/image.png)  
    At this point you're half way to finishing.
    

### If you DO NOT own the S.O.G Prairie Fire DLC, you must do the following:

If you already bought the DLC from Steam, then you can ignore this part.

1.  Download  [S.O.G Prairie fire compatibility mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2477276806)  from the Steam workshop. Make sure it's fully downloaded. Once the mod has downloaded on Steam, you  **MUST**  open the Arma 3 Launcher using Steam and make sure that you can start the game using the mod. Close the game after this. This is just to confirm that the mod is fully downloaded - you will not be using Steam to open your game with play with us.
    
2.   Add your  `!workshop`  folder to the list of additional search folders.  
    **The folder is hidden by default.**  [How to make hidden folders visible](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5#WindowsVersion=Windows_11)  
    It is located in your Arma 3 installation folder.
    Once you've shown the hidden folders, return to the Swifty homepage. In the top right of the program, click the  ![Swifty Cog](https://i.imgur.com/CWD89aA.png)  icon, go to "Additonal search folders" and navigate to your  `!workshop`  folder in your Arma 3 directory.  ![Global Conflicts Swifty repository Configuration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/745428128528203829/938997192679632927/unknown.png)

On the configuration tab,  **remove**  the  _`-mod=vn`_  param from your parameters line: This param would tell the game to use the DLC If you had bought it.  ![Global Conflicts Swifty repository Configuration](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/745428128528203829/927563776633503784/unknown.png)
