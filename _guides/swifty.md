# How to setup your mods

1.  Download the mod launcher  [here](https://getswifty.net/releases/Setup.exe)  and install it.
    
2.  Once installed, open Swifty, and in the top left, click  **Add Repository**, and then insert the URL below <br/> `https://swifty.globalconflicts.net/`
    
3.  Click  **Import from URL**  <br/>

4.  In the field called  **path**, direct Swifty to where you want to install your mods.  
    This can be anywhere, inside or out the Arma directory. Just make sure it's on the same HDD/SSD as your Arma 3.  
    Create a folder with a descriptive name, such as "Global Conflicts Mods" in your chosen location and select this folder.
    
5.  In the top right hand corner, click the little  ![Swifty Cog](https://i.imgur.com/CWD89aA.png)  icon.  
    Once opened, you'll see a tab called application, and in here a field called "Arma III Directory", this is the path to your Arma 3 folder. <br/>By default it's in your "steamapps" folder. You can find it by right clicking your Arma 3 on Steam > Manage > Browse Game Files.
    
    Increasing the parallel downloads can increase the download speed. <br/>  ![image](https://i.imgur.com/D8ZwPh5.png)  
    At this point you're half way to finishing.
    

### If you DO NOT own the S.O.G Prairie Fire DLC, you must do the following:

If you already bought the DLC from Steam, then you can ignore this part.

1.  Download  [S.O.G Prairie fire compatibility mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2477276806)  from the Steam workshop. Make sure it's fully downloaded.<br/> Once the mod has downloaded on Steam, you  **MUST**  open the vanilla/default Arma 3 launcher from steam atleast one time. <br/>This is to let the mod validate and finish downloading, which should take a few seconds - You do not need to open the actual game.
    
2.   Add your  `!workshop`  folder to the list of additional search folders.  It is located in your Arma 3 installation folder. <br/>
    **The folder is hidden by default.**  [How to make hidden folders visible](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5#WindowsVersion=Windows_11)  
    Once you've shown the hidden folders, return to the Swifty homepage. In the top right of the program, click the  ![Swifty Cog](https://i.imgur.com/CWD89aA.png)  icon, go to "Additonal search folders" and navigate to your  `!workshop`  folder in your Arma 3 directory. <br/> ![image](https://github.com/TheLocalPub/global-conflicts-website/assets/4511118/f15be187-fb0d-4b66-b055-332f8e067595)

    
3.  Go back to the Swifty homepage, and click the  ![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/CWD89aA.png)  Icon below our banner image to go into the settings for our repository![Global Conflicts Cog Icon](https://i.imgur.com/huJFXzB.jpg)

4.  On the configuration tab,  **remove**  the  _`-mod=vn`_  param from your parameters line<br/> This param would tell the game to use the DLC If you had bought it. <br/> ![image](https://i.imgur.com/HH8nTX5.png)

    
5.  In the repository settings, navigate to the "External addons" tab.  
    Find the  `@S.O.G Prairie fire - Creator DLC combability data for non owners`  mod and enable it. <br/> ![image](https://i.imgur.com/yObfVkc.png)
    

_This concludes the necessary steps for those who do not own the S.O.G Prairie Fire DLC. The following applies to everyone._

### And finally...

Click the  **Check Now**  button in the banner if you see it. <br/> ![Global Conflicts Swifty repository](https://i.imgur.com/fBU5yGY.png)  
Swifty will do a check to make sure everything is working correctly. Once this done, the red banner should disappear, and you can click launch at the bottom.
