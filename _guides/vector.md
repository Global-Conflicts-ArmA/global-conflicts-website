# How to use a vector

The Vector is controlled with 2 keys: the azimuth key and the range key <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd> and is brought up like any other binoculars.

#### Setting the measurement units (degrees/mils & meters/feet)

 - Tap <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> five times fast. “Unit SEtt” appears briefly.
 - Press <kbd>R</kbd> until the desired units are displayed.
 - Tap <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> five times fast to save.

#### Slope distance

 - Press and hold the <kbd>R</kbd> until the red pointing circle appears. Sight the circle on the object and release the key.

#### Azimuth

 - Press and hold the <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> until the azimuth is displayed.

#### Slope distance and azimuth

 - Press and hold both the <kbd>R</kbd> and <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> untill the red pointing circle appears.
 - Sight the circle on the object and release both keys.

#### Horizontal distance and height difference

 - Tap <kbd>R</kbd> once then press and hold it until the red pointing circle appears.
 - Sight the circle on the object and release the key.

#### Azimuth and Inclination

 - Tap <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> once then press and hold it until the azimuth and inclination is displayed.

#### Distance between two points

 - Press and hold <kbd>R</kbd> until the red poinint circle appears.
 - Sight the circle on the first object and tap <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> while further holding <kbd>R</kbd>. The first measurement is confirmed ("1-P = first point).
 - Sight the second object and release <kbd>R</kbd>

#### Horizontal and vertical distance between two points

 - Tap <kbd>R</kbd> once then press and hold it until the red pointing circle appears.
 - Sight the circle on the object and tap <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> once. The first measurement is confirmed ("1-P = first point).
 - Sight the second object and release <kbd>R</kbd>

#### Horizontal distance and azimuth between two points
- Press and hold <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> until the azimuth appears.
 - Sight the circle on the first object and tap <kbd>R</kbd> while further holding <kbd>R</kbd>. The first measurement is confirmed ("1-P = first point).
 - Sight the second object and release <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd> 

#### Fall of shot

 - Tap <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd>  once then press and hold it until the azimuth appears.
 - Sight the circle on the object and tap <kbd>R</kbd> while further holding <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd>. The first measurement is confirmed ("1-P = first point)..
 - Sight the fall of shot and release <kbd>Tab&nbsp;↹</kbd>. The left digits display the left (`L`)/right (`r`) correction value in meter and the right digits display the longer (`A` = add)/shorter (`d` = drop) correction value in meter. If <kbd>R</kbd> is tapped the height correction values will be displayed (`UP` and `dn`).
