# Introduction to Mission Making

#### Getting started

So you wish to begin making missions here at Global Conflicts.  
First things first, you'll need to know a couple of things before we can actually get to the meat and potatoes of mission making.

You'll need some sort of text editor when mission making.  

[Notepad++ is a lightweight and advanced text editor.](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)  

[It's also recommended to download the .SQF extenstion for Notepad++ which will help with programming.](https://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=8680)  

[You could also try Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Both have equivalent .SQF extensions.

## Community Framework

Almost all missions at GC are constructed using a framework, which aids mission makers greatly and helps to increase mission quality and turn-over time.  

You can download our community framework and find out further details regarding its capabilities  [here](https://github.com/Global-Conflicts-ArmA/Olsen-Framework-Arma-3/tree/master)  

## Mission Naming

Our mission formats are the following:

-   *CO* - Player v AI
-   *TVT* - Player vs player
-   *COTVT* - Player and/or AI vs player and/or AI
-   *LOL* - A mission designed to basically be a meme with sometimes no context.  
  
When you upload the mission using our website, you must name it as you would mention it, example:  *Operation Enduring Freedom*.  No CO/TVT, no player number, no version - just the name.  This is how the mission name will appear on the list on the website.  
The version will be automatically incremented based on your future updates of this mission. It starts at V1.  
The .pbo file you must select must contain at least the map name:  *op_enduring_freedom._altis_.pbo*.    
When the file is uploaded we rename it based on the information provided. Only the map name is necessary to be present and correct in the .pbo file you will upload.
